Capstone project(partially- which is the ghost hunting addition)
Ever want to know what goes bump in the night? What if you witnessed a bump in the night? On this fun app we are able to hunt, report, and find Bigfoot, Ghosts, UFO's. I am personally doing Bigfoot and UFO's .. My team for college will be doing ghosts. This will consist of at-least three CSV files. 
This is a crash course intro to MongoDB, if you are not familiar with Mongo.
